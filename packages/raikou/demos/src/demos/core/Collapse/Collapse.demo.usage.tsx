          From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pok√©mon that has
          blue-green skin with darker patches. It has red eyes with white
          pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short,
          blunt snout with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are
          visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each of its thick
          legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur&apos;s back is a green
          plant bulb, which is grown from a seed planted there at birth. The
          bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides it
          with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich
          seeds contained within.
